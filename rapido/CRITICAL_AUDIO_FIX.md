# CRITICAL AUDIO FIX - Addressing "still SHIT" Issue

## Observed Problems from Logs
1. **36 Audio Underruns** - Buffer constantly running empty
2. **Buffer at 160ms** instead of 320ms target
3. **FPS at 17-18** instead of 25 target
4. **Frame duplications** - 71 frames duplicated

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Buffer Threshold Fix (DONE)
- Changed minimum playback buffer from 160ms to 40ms
- Was causing premature silence generation
- Now only generates silence when critically low

### 2. Initial Buffer Requirement (DONE)
- Reduced from 320ms to 256ms (80%)
- Allows playback to start sooner

### 3. Audio Smoother (DONE)
- Smooths SyncTalk chunk boundaries
- Prevents crackling from 40ms chunks

## Remaining Issue
The core problem appears to be **audio production/consumption mismatch**. 
The system can't maintain the buffer because:
- TTS might be slow
- SyncTalk processing might be delayed
- Network latency

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Check if TTS is actually streaming fast enough
2. Monitor SyncTalk websocket for delays
3. Consider reducing audio quality for lower latency
4. Check CPU usage - might be overloaded
