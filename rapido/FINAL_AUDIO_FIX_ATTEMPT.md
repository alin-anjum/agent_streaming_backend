# FINAL AUDIO FIX ATTEMPT

## All Changes Applied

### 1. Buffer Sizes Reduced for Better Flow
- **HIGH_QUALITY**: target 320ms → 200ms, max 400ms → 280ms
- **Initial requirement**: Now 160ms (80% of 200ms)
- This prevents buffer from getting too full and causing delays

### 2. Silence Generation Threshold Lowered
- **Min playback buffer**: Now only 40ms (one frame)
- Was 160ms (50% of target) - too aggressive
- Should dramatically reduce underruns

### 3. Audio Smoother DISABLED
- Temporarily disabled to eliminate as a variable
- Was potentially causing timing issues
- Can be re-enabled if needed

## Expected Improvements
✅ **Underruns**: Should drop from 36 to < 5
✅ **Buffer level**: Should maintain 160-200ms consistently
✅ **Audio flow**: More continuous, less silence injection
✅ **Latency**: Lower overall latency

## What This Fixes
1. **Aggressive silence generation** - now only when critically low
2. **Buffer overfilling** - reduced max to prevent backup
3. **Initial delay** - starts playback at 160ms not 320ms
4. **Potential smoother issues** - eliminated by disabling

## To Run
Just start the system normally. You should see:
- "⚠️ Audio smoother DISABLED for testing"
- Buffer maintaining around 160-200ms
- Much fewer underruns
- Better audio quality

## If STILL Bad
The problem is likely **upstream**:
1. **TTS is too slow** - ElevenLabs latency
2. **Network delays** - WebSocket or Internet issues
3. **SyncTalk processing** - Can't keep up with real-time
4. **System overload** - CPU/GPU maxed out

## Debug Commands
Monitor these metrics in logs:
- "Underruns:" - should be < 5
- "Buffer XXX/200ms" - should stay 120-200
- "SYNCTALK PRODUCTION: XX FPS" - should be ~25
