This process typically starts with writing the code in a text editor or integrated development environment IDE. The code is then compiled or interpreted depending on the language. Finally the program is executed either through a command line interface or within the IDE. This execution process helps developers familiarize themselves with the tools and workflows used in their specific work environment.",
