      "text": "Computer networks form the backbone of modern digital communication and data sharing. These interconnected systems enable businesses to operate efficiently, collaborate globally, and access vast information resources. Understanding the fundamentals of computer networks is crucial for professionals in today's technology-driven workplace.A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources. The primary components of a network include servers, clients, routers, switches, and transmission media. Servers are powerful computers that store and provide access to data and services. Clients are devices like desktop computers, laptops, or smartphones that users interact with to access network resources. Routers direct data traffic between different networks, while switches manage data flow within a single network. Transmission media, such as Ethernet cables or wireless signals, carry data between devices. Computer networks come in various types and configurations. Local Area Networks (LANs) connect devices within a limited area, such as an office building. Wide Area Networks (WANs) span larger geographical areas, often connecting multiple LANs across cities or countries. Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) cover a city or large campus. Network topologies describe the physical or logical arrangement of devices. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh configurations. Each topology has unique advantages and applications in different workplace environments. Data transmission in computer networks relies on protocols, which are standardized rules for communication. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is fundamental to most modern networks, providing reliable data delivery and addressing. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) enables web browsing, while Ethernet is a widely used protocol for local network communications. These protocols work together to ensure data is accurately transmitted, received, and interpreted by network devices.",
